- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ziattak
- 👀 I’m interested in making Minecraft mods for you guys
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and possibly Java for modmaking
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my Minecraft mod EquiX
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not usually on the computer on a regular basis, so you can try and go on GitHub at any random moment and, hey, I might be there!

<!---
I haven't begun my Minecraft mod yet, but I will let you kn ow when I begin it!
